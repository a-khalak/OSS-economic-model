This file lists the parameters for the various studies:

for code bank study:

   constants:
   scheme = 'equal price, comp quant, all raise';
   number of users:   2500
   number of companies: 10

   span:
   bpref and bran

   cases:
   A) Demand variables min_price=0.8, max_price=3.0
   B) Demand variables min_price=0.3, max_price=3.0


for size study:

   constants:
   scheme = 'equal price, comp quant, all raise';
   min_price = 0.8
   max_price = 0.3
   
   span:
   N,M increase exponentially from N=100 to 5500

   cases:
   a) corporate costs scale (go down win incr. M to keep total const)
   b) corporate costs are fixed
   c) somewhat finer resolutions

   1> 1% companies
   5> 5% companies
   10> 10% companies
